<p class="meta">27 June 2011 - Lincoln</p>

## The Story:
[Ben Milne](http://benmilne.com/), the man behind [Dwolla](https://dwolla.com) (a cool payment processing system targeted at developers), tweeted this:

![bpmilne-servers](/images/posts/bpmilne-servers-openneb.png "Servers for all!")

It just so happens, [Ross](https://twitter.com/rossnelson) and I have [two](http://hackneb.org) secret [projects](http://openneb.org) of our own.  So we did the only natural thing, we pitched them!  Shortly after we were offered a pair of servers and were road-tripping to [Des Moines](http://desmob.com/) for servers and a tiny little cup of coffee.

## The Aftermath:

We got back to Lincoln late Thursday night, [roasted some marshmallows](http://twitpic.com/5fx9md), got to playing with the servers, and took inventory.

Ross spent Friday rounding up missing hardware including some RAM and a few SATA cables (thanks to [Reliant Transportation]() and [Frank](https://twitter.com/hulign)).

## The Punchline:
Today I am happy to announce that [Frank](https://twitter.com/server_frank) and [Bob](https://twitter.com/bob) are up and running and ready to start working.

A big thanks to [Ben Milne](http://benmilne.com/) and [Dwolla](https://dwolla.com) for being awesome!

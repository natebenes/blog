## I have a problem:
For those of you who know me, I watch very little TV; in part because I'm busy, and part because my TV is only 7" across.  But the one show I always make sure to catch is the [Daily Show](http://thedailyshow.com) on Comedy Central.

Lately, I've been really frustrated by all of the reruns they've been airing.  To their credit, if you dig around on their website long enough, somewhere they list whether or not there is a new episode, but its not easy to find and it has way more information than I care to read.  I like things concise and to the point.  So last night I wrote up this page:

[stdio.me/is-tds-new](http://stdio.me/is-tds-new)

It gives you a simple answer in big black letters.  Its the result of almost 15 minutes of effort so if you see anything buggy, let me know.
